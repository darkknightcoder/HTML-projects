            <p>
               I am a graduated student in mathematics and its applications from National University of Iran, Tehran ( nowadays known as Shahid Beheshti University of Tehran ). While I was a mathematics student, have I finished my Web Designing courses at Tehran Institute of Technology with a total of 175 hours of study of web materials ( HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and PHP ). It’s been approx 3 years and 9 months that I am working on web science studies, projects and looking forward to improve all my skills as a web developer and specifically my team work ability which is very important in teamwork while you are working on a project.

               As a birthday gift, my parents gave me a Canon 70D DSLR Camera with which, till this moment, I have gained a lot experience working with it in lots of occasions. Having said that, now I can call myself a Photographer. Also I used to be a teacher while was a student at high school. For instance,I used to teach math and physics to lower grade schoolmates whom were completely satisfied with my method of teaching and the way have I consulted them. The more I want to say, the more it will take time.
